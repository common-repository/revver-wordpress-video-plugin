== Description ==

**Your own interactive video portal**

Whether you're new to videoblogging or a seasoned content producer, the Revver Wordpress Video Plugin gives you all the tools you need to create your own personalized video sharing solution. Publish, manage, and track your video content all without ever leaving your own website, and even allow your subscribers to submit their own video responses to your posts! It's your own interactive video portal, made simple with Revver and Wordpress.


**Video Blogging In Seconds**

The Revver Wordpress Video Plugin allows you to upload videos directly through your blog. You don't even need to wait for the video to go live before publishing your post -- just save your post as soon as it's ready to view, it goes live on your site. You can also browse the entire Revver library right from your blog and post videos with the click of a button.


**Your Blog, Your Way**

It's your blog, so build it however you want. Once you've perfected your design, just activate the plugin and you're ready to start posting video straight to your site. To help bring traffic back to your site, share links to your videos point directly back to your site!


**Earn Money**

You worked hard to produce your content, so why should someone else get paid for it? With the Revver Wordpress Video Plugin, you actually earn money when people watch your videos. The more people watch, the more you can earn. For more details, see [how Revver works](http://revver.com/go/faq#general2 "Revver FAQ").


**Manage Your Video Library**

The plugin allows you to manage your entire video library right from your blog -- view, edit and even remove any video you own right from your site, whether you posted it via Revver.com, using the plugin, or on another Revverized site. You can even manage your subscriber videos!


**Subscriber Videos**

When people register on your blog, a Revver account is automatically created for them -- the plugin allows them to upload video responses and earn directly through your blog! You earn as a sharer and your subscribers earn as creators on all video responses submitted to your site. Let your fans speak out!


**About Revver**

Revver is a video-sharing platform built the way the internet really works. We support the free and unlimited sharing of media. Our unique technology tracks and monetizes videos as they spread virally across the web, so no matter where your creativity travels, you benefit. 

Revver was the first viral video network to pay creators for their work and sharers for distributing it - connecting video makers and sharers with sponsors in a free and open marketplace that rewards them for doing what they do best.
